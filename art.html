                <p class="pFont">For the time being, I am unable to receive payment for commissions. Yes, this means I draw “for free.” This also means I can and will be very picky about whose commissions I accept or deny. If you wish to commission me, be nice.</p>
                <hr>
                <h1 class="displayFont"><b>Overview</b></h1>
                <p class="pFont">My name is Amethyst, and I'm a hobbyist digital artist. I mostly draw anthropomorphic animals, commonly known as furries. My portfolio is on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/am3thystx"><u>my DeviantArt profile</u></a>.</p>
                <p class="pFont">When the commission status on my website says 'OPEN,' you can commission me to draw custom artwork of your character. Please have a reference sheet or viable reference artwork that I can use while making your commission.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>I reserve the right to deny any commission for any reason. Even if a commission does not violate the Terms of Service, I can still deny it at my discretion. If you continue to try to break these terms of service or find loopholes, your commission will be denied, and you will be blacklisted and blocked.</b></p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>My official Terms of Service are public on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aIm5ktOR8iT6Iny218QbIIvcFt7GBtDYWGgVBmYZbQ/mobilebasic"><u>Google Docs</u></a>. When I update my terms, the Terms of Service on this website may become temporarily outdated. Both copies of these terms are subject to change.</b></p>
                <br>
                <h1 class="displayFont"><b>What I'll Draw</b></h1>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Profile Pictures</b><br>A square image meant to be used as a profile picture on your social media profiles.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Ref Sheets</b><br>A reference image featuring your character from multiple perspectives, their accessories, and a color palette. Ref sheets display your character fully so that other artists know how to draw them.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Stickers</b><br>An image with a transparent background designed to be printed onto stickers and cut out. Note that I cannot print them for you.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Custom Requests</b><br>I'm open to any custom requests you may have, but you must be clear about what you want. (And it must not violate my Terms of Service)</p>
                <br>
                <h1 class="displayFont"><b>What I'm Still Learning</b></h1>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Human Characters</b><br>I specialize in furries (and maybe ferals) but have little experience drawing humans.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Detailed Backgrounds</b><br>Due to the nature of my style and the software I use, detailed backgrounds may not be possible.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Uncommon Poses</b><br>I'm still learning anatomy to improve my art. Simple poses are okay, but I might need references for anything complex.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Rendering</b><br>Because of the limitations of vector drawing software, I can't "render" or apply detailed shading to my art. One day, I'll get a drawing tablet. One day…</p>
                <br>
                <h1 class="displayFont"><b>What I Will Not Draw</b></h1>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Sexually Explicit Content</b><br>This is self-explanatory.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Incitement of Hate or Violence</b><br>This is self-explanatory.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Gore</b><br>A little bit of blood is okay. Healed scars are okay. Characters designed with detached body parts are okay. Extreme injuries and/or pain are not okay.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Photorealism or Extreme Complexity</b><br>I do not take commissions for photorealistic or extremely complex pieces that exceed my artistic capabilities or style.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Copyrighted Artwork</b><br>I will not create artwork of commercial mascots or other copyrighted characters. Do not use my art for commercial purposes unless explicitly agreed upon.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Characters that Aren't Yours</b><br>Without explicit permission, I will not draw characters that belong to someone else, not even "as a gift."</p>
                <br>
                <h1 class="displayFont"><b>Commission-Specific Terms</b></h1>
                <s>
                    <p class="pFont"><b>Payment</b><br>Payment details will be discussed and agreed upon before starting the commission, but PayPal is my go-to payment method. Depending on the nature of the commission, full or partial payment upfront may be required.</p>
                    <p class="pFont"><b>Refunds</b><br>Refunds will only be issued under certain circumstances, such as if I cannot complete the commission. In the event of upfront payment, once work has commenced, partial refunds may be considered based on the amount of work completed.</p>
                </s>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Revisions</b><br>Revisions are easier to make the earlier they are requested. After the piece is completed, revisions will be limited to a certain number based on the complexity of the commission. <s>Additional revisions or large-scale revisions beyond this may incur extra charges.</s></p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Deadlines</b><br>I can provide an estimated completion date, but this is subject to change based on my workload and personal circumstances. I will try to communicate any delays as soon as possible.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Usage Rights</b><br>Unless otherwise agreed upon, I retain the right to display the commissioned artwork in my portfolio and social media. You may use the artwork for personal use only unless commercial use is explicitly agreed upon <s>and additional fees are paid</s>.</p>
                <p class="pFont"><b>Privacy</b><br>Any personal information you share (your age, timezone, etc.) during the commission process will be kept confidential and used solely for the purpose of completing the commission.</p>
